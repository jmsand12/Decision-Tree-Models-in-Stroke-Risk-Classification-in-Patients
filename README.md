As one of the author of the journal "Analisis Faktor Dominan dan Peningkatan Akurasi Model Pohon Keputusan dalam Klasifikasi Risiko Stroke pada Pasien," I contributed significantly to the project's success by focusing on data preprocessing until evaluation for the modelling. My responsibilities included handling missing values, identifying and removing outliers, and ensuring the dataset's quality for accurate predictions. Leveraging the CRISP-DM methodology, I supported the team's efforts to develop a pruned decision tree model that emphasized key features such as BMI and average glucose levels. These contributions resulted in a model with enhanced accuracy and interpretability, offering valuable insights for early stroke risk classification.
